# Project Title: Krakow-Transport-Accessibility-ILWIS

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on assessing transportation accessibility in the city of Kraków using the Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS). This project marks the beginning of our journey into spatial data analysis.

## Project Objectives
The main objective of this exercise is to enhance our understanding of how to utilize the ILWIS environment for spatial data analysis. The project involves analyzing various datasets to evaluate the accessibility of transportation options in Kraków, aiming to identify ideal residential locations for individuals prioritizing ease of movement.

## Key Features
- **Utilization of ILWIS**: Learning to work with the ILWIS environment for grid and raster data analysis.
- **Data Acquisition**: Collecting relevant datasets to evaluate transportation accessibility.
- **Accessibility Indicators**: Assessing transportation accessibility through various metrics, including:
  - Number of bus stops in each district.
  - Proximity to the nearest ambulance services.
  - Availability of railway lines.
  - Distance to schools.
  - Proximity to low-traffic roads.

## Analysis Process
The analysis involves several steps, including:
1. Data acquisition.
2. Defining residential zones.
3. Evaluating public transport stops.
4. Assessing ambulance and school proximity.
5. Analyzing traffic patterns.

## Findings and Conclusions
The project enhances our skills in using ILWIS for spatial data analysis and helps us understand how to create informative maps based on the analyzed data. The skills acquired during this project will allow us to conduct independent analyses in the future.
